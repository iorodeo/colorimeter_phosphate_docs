Introduction
===============================================


We have experimented with four different methods for measuring phosphate levels in water samples with the colorimeter.
The first 3 methods listed below use the common ascorbic acid method (APHA Standard Method 4500-P E) and can be used to measure up to 30 ppm phosphate depending on the test you use. 
For high range phosphate levels, there is also the vanadate-molybdate method (APHA Standard Method 4500-P C).

#. **Ascorbic acid method** - Uses a number of reagents. Prepare fresh testing reagent each time.
#. **Hach PhosVer3 reagent** - Powdered reagent. Requires mixing and timing.
#. **API test kit** - 2 x bottles of liquid reagents. Requires measuring within 5-10 minutes of adding the last reagent.
#. **Vanadate-molybdate method**. Liquid reagent. Easy test but only for high-range phosphate. 

Of these four methods, we have used the **Hach PhosVer3** reagent the most. Although it does require a mixing step, the reagent is easy to use and we find the test has reproducible results so far.
